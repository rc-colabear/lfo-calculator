## Why was the calculator created? 

To assist decision makers and advocates in understanding the complexities of LFOs and to help them navigate what must be considered before LFOs are imposed. Courts will be able to immediately understand at the time of sentencing what the monthly payments must be in order to pay off the LFOs in a reasonable amount of time and how that corresponds with a person's ability to pay.
