+++

## Why was the calculator created? 

To assist decision makers and advocates in understanding the complexities of LFOs and to help them navigate what must be considered before LFOs are imposed. Courts will be able to immediately understand at the time of sentencing what the monthly payments must be in order to pay off the LFOs in a reasonable amount of time and how that corresponds with a person's ability to pay.

## Who can use this calculator?  

Anyone. The calculator was designed with the end user to be Washington State judges. However, defense attorneys and prosecutors who practice in Washington State are also encouraged to use the calculator to prepare their sentencing recommendations to the court.

## Does the calculator take away judicial discretion? 

No. The calculator is designed to assist judges in what they are already required to do --- determine a person's ability to pay LFOs and understand when LFOs can be imposed. The ultimate decision of what should be imposed at sentencing is up to the judge. The calculator was designed to reflect current statutes and judicial practice, it does not replace the authority of statutes or case law that address LFOs.

## Is the calculator tracking my information? 

As you can see, nowhere does the calculator ask for a defendant's name, case number, name of court, or name of the user. We do, however, ask that you self-identify your occupation in the criminal justice system and hit "FINISH" on page four when you are done. The data collected will not be associated with any individual or court, but will be available for the commission to analyze in the aggregate.

## Is the calculator up to date on the laws surrounding LFOs? 

The goal is to keep the calculator up to date with current law and judicial practices. If you notice something amiss, please send us some feedback.

## How do I find a crime in the calculator?

* Enter a keyword in the name of crime or RCW (use roman numerals for degree of crime). Common acronyms are recognized (i.e. DWLS). All crimes with the key word will appear in dropdown list. 
* Select from dropdown list BEFORE hitting "ENTER" or "NEXT." (Otherwise correct LFOs may not appear.)
* Note that if LFOs are not different between a crime and attempted version of that crime, both crimes will be listed together in dropdown list.

## What if the case has multiple charges? 

You can add multiple charges, as many as you choose. The calculator assumes that the charges you add are all part of the same cause number.

## What about older DUI/Physical Control cases? 

The calculator has incorporated the proper LFOs related to the date of violation. The calculator will automatically default to the present time frame. You must use the dropdown selection to select previous time frames. Note that the LFOs for DUI/Physical Control crimes with date of violation between 7/22/01 to 7/26/03 shown on the previously published DUI historical grid are wrong. The calculator has corrected these LFOs and confirmed the corrected numbers with AOC.

## Why can't defense attorneys fill this out ahead of time? 

They can. They can print out page 4 and submit it for the sentencing hearing as what they are recommending regarding LFOs. They also can enter the information in the calculator before the hearing, select "FINISH" on page 4 to get a URL and email the URL to the Court and Prosecutor as their recommended sentence regarding LFOs. The judge can go to the URL, change the user to "Judge" and make any necessary changes without having to retype/enter all the information.

## Can the calculator remember my preferences, so I don't have to re-enter them every time? 

As long as you are using the same device to access the calculator, it will remember your preferences such as type of user, probation fees, rate of community service credits and which LFOs you have chosen to "collapse" because it is not one you commonly impose. Selecting "RESET" on page four will clear all your preferences.
